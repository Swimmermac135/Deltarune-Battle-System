How do I store what action correlates to what actually happens?

For ACTIONS (Attack, spare, etc), I could most likely tie a script to each button that runs the next step in the code.
(Opening the selector button for ITEM, enemy select for ACT/SPARE/MAGIC/ETC)

ACTs will probably have a struct with their name, TP cost, and a run script as well as a conditions check script that would dictate wether or not the act is valid

Example:
ACT_pacify = {

	name : "Pacify",
	cost : 16,
	executionScript  : scr_pacifyExecute,
	validationScript : scr_pacifyValidate,
	
}

where executionScript is called when the turn actually begins (after PLAYERSELECTING phase is complete) and validationScript is called whenever the player tries
to select the act for usage (as well as the system renders it to see if it renders gray for invalid or normal for valid [or a different color for special])

So selecting ACTION.ACT would run the ACTION.ACT script which would open the enemy selection screen. Perhaps there should be a flag for single fights that skips the selector screen.

For some reason, Enemies have all of their render data stored within the object. Well, I say for some reason but I know why, I wrote the system lol
Enemies have their own render code because I want it to be easier than the rendering system for characters. It is the same reason why all combat logic is stored in one object
Having to have the different aspects of the combat system crosstalk would be annoying, so having it centralized is better here
For enemies, who are simpler in design (characters have a lot more animations, menu code, etc), I think having them be in self contained objects is okay.
