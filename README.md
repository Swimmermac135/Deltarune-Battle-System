All Art and Sound Effects/Music are created by TOBY FOX and ROYAL SCIENCES/ the DELTARUNE team. Sprite rips were found on [Spriters Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/) and music/sound effects were found on various soundboard websites.
Most of the code is written by me, with credit to Juju Adams, Alynne Keith, and Friends for the amazing Scribble and Input packages, and XGASOFT for GML+ timer functions
